# LocationMarker
The application has been implemented in C++ using Qt development framework. It shows the list of
already saved markers and new markers which can be added and removed. Please also see demo
video. Deployed Application in release folder. The source code is in ProjectSolution folder
Certain points were taken into mind while developing this:
1) The current implementation is considered as 2D. When the word ‘marker’ comes into mind, a
marker similar to the one that you can see in Google Maps was considered as a prerequisite concept.
2) We have a list of already 8 saved markers which is clickable and displays the coordinates. For
the current implementation, these cannot be added or removed.
3) New markers can be added and removed. Also, displays the coordinates when clicked. Saved
markers cannot be removed.
